#+TITLE: Notes on books
#+AUTHOR: @frankpf

These are my personal notes on books I'm currently reading/have already read.
Each book has its own README and set of notes in a subdirectory.

The notes were taken using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and the awesome [[http://orgmode.org][Org mode]].
